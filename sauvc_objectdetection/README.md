## Install
Here is the list of libraries you need to install to execute the code:
- python = 3.6
- cv2
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- scikit-image
- natsort
- math
- datetime

## Easy Usage
1. Complete the running environment configuration;
2. Put the inputs images to corresponding folders :
  - (create 'InputImages' and 'OutputImages' folders, then put raw images to 'InputImages' folder);
3. Python main.py;
4. Find the enhanced/restored images in "OutputImages" folder.
